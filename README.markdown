bluewoki
========

bluewoki is a simple walkie-talkie over Bluetooth and wifi for devices
running iOS 4.0+. It allows iPhone and iPod Touch devices to connect to
each other via Bluetooth or a wifi network to exchange vocal messages.
When using Bluetooth, the devices must be close enough to each other so
that they can connect.

The application is [available at the App Store][1].

The source code is released under a liberal BSD license. The project
uses and includes the [AsyncSocket library][2], which is in the public
domain.

Xcode 4.1 is required to open the project.

FAQ

### Why charging for open source software?

This question has already been raised in the case of [Tux Raider World
Challenge][3] and I will simply quote one of its FAQ entries:

> Tux Rider is an Open Source software that complies to the GPLv2. Hence
> the source code is made available to all clients. Yet, the GPLv2
> doesn't says that the author cannot be rewarded for his work. In fact,
> there is a widely spread misunderstanding that says that Open Source
> equals free of charge.  The free software foundation clearly explains:
> “Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the
> concept, you should think of free as in free speech, not as in free
> beer.” — The Free Software Definition (GNU - FSF)

### Any other comment?

Read this [amazing article by Zed Shaw][4]. I completely agree with his
views on licensing.
